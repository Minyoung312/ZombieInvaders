# Zombie Invaders
The objective of this game is to get rid of as many zombies by hitting them with your ax before they reach the end. Each time you hit a zombie, your score will increase, but when even one zombie reaches the end, it is game over. To throw your ax press the Space button, and use the arrows to move the character. Please make sure pygame is downloaded if you are going to run this program.

Enjoy!
