# Zombie Invaders
Welcome to my first Pygame. The objective of this game is to get rid of as many zombies by hitting them with your ax before they reach the end. To throw your ax press the Space button, and use the arrows to move the character. One way to run this game is to first download the zip for this game, click on the file in your downloads (make sure the file is not compressed, if not you must extract the file). Next, you open up the command prompt by clicking on the file URL, and type cmd. Once in the command prompt type python3 main.py. 
You must download pygame in order for this game to run. To that, type -m pip install pygame. 


Enjoy!
